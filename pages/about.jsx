                    <p className="font-regular text-gray-500 text-lg mb-4">My life is dedicated to the art, my family, and all those who follow my work. Everything makes sense when we give joy and love equally to ourselves and others.</p>

                    <p className="font-regular text-gray-500 text-lg mb-8">Because of that, here I will record everything that makes my life worthwhile and inspire all those who want the same for themselves. Art is a world in which we shape our character and everyday life. Every breath is worth as much as we enjoy art. So letâ€™s together create a life worth living.</p>
